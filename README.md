# What is ghost

Ghost is a software made to hide files that would normally be flagged as suspicious so that they can be transferred to other devices without being flagged

# How to use ghost

## Linux

```shell
./ghost <OPTIONS> -in <INPUT FILE> -out <OUTPUTFILE>
```

# Options

- -r: Revive, turns the ghosted file back to its original form

# To add

- Directly load exes into memory
- Exe wrapper so that ghost is not needed on the other system, exe can simply be run and will be automatically revived
- Exe splice and scramble
